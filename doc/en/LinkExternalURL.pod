LinkExternalURL - enable linking a ticket with URLs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With this package installed, you can link a ticket with URLs. This can be useful if
you articles in that ticket references external URLs and you don't want to search
each article for such references.

When this package is installed, you can view a ticket (AgentTicketZoom) and click on
'Link'. Then you can choose 'URL' as the target object.

If you search for an URL that is not in the database, it is added. The title is extracted
from the content retrieved when the URL is fetched.

The linked URLs are shown as Links in the ticket zoom.
